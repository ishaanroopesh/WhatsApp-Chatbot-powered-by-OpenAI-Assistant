CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
    python -m venv <environment_name>

ACTIVATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
    source <environment_name>/bin/activate

DEACTIVATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
    deactivate

The modules installed under the virtual environment are seperate from the ones already installed on the system. using "pip list", while in different environments helps us to understand the differences. The new modules to be installed must be done within the virtual environment.

INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT TESTING
    make sure to change your interactive environment to the virtual environment that was created. This allows to use the specific packages that were downloaded for the project.
